Problem Statement:
  Efficient cross-border capital movement is fundamental to modern corporate finance, yet global money flows remain burdened by high friction, opacity, and inconsistent regulatory environments. When capital is transferred from one jurisdiction to another, it rarely travels in a straight, bilateral path. Instead, funds frequently pass through multiple intermediary countries—each introducing incremental costs, delays, compliance requirements, and FX risks.
Despite the scale of international financial activity, corporations still lack a transparent, data-driven mechanism to understand how capital depreciates in value as it moves across borders or how alternative routing strategies could substantially reduce friction.
Currently, the capital flow ecosystem suffers from the following structural problems:
1. Fragmented Regulatory and Tax Frameworks
  Each jurisdiction imposes unique tax treaties, withholding norms, capital control rules, and documentation standards. These inconsistencies create unpredictable friction, making it extremely difficult for decision-makers to estimate end-to-end transfer implications across multi-hop routes.
2. Hidden Financial Leakages Across Corridors
  Capital loses value due to FX spreads, correspondent banking fees, settlement delays, and compliance overheads. These leakages are not disclosed transparently; companies typically discover the true cost only post-settlement.
3. Lack of Visibility Into Multi-Hop Pathways
  Corporates and treasury teams have no tool to simulate how funds would behave if routed through 2 or 3 intermediate jurisdictions. For example, routing India → Singapore → UK might be cheaper or faster than India → UK directly, but no existing platform computes or ranks such multi-hop alternatives.
4. Absence of Predictive Intelligence
  There is no ML-driven system that can score international corridors based on real-world frictions such as geopolitical risk, capital control stringency, transaction volatility, or historical settlement performance.
5. Non-Explainable Financial Decision-Making
  Even when financial institutions provide recommendations, they do not offer transparent, explainable reasons behind the suggested route. Decision-makers are forced to rely on opaque systems with limited clarity on why a route is more efficient.
6. High Economic Impact
  Countries like India experience capital inefficiencies running into thousands of crores, driven solely by poor routing choices and limited visibility into optimized pathways. Treasury mis-optimization leads to avoidable loss of enterprise value—despite no change in business fundamentals.
